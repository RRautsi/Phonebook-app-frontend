# Phonebook-app-frontend
### Phonebook app made with React and styled with Tailwind CSS.

This app was made as an assignment for Full Stack Open 2022 -course.

As extra, I imported Tailwind to the project and used it to style everything. This was first time I used Tailwind so it was a good learning experience.

If you want to try the app, I recommend cloning only backend since it has frontend code in "build" folder. You also need to use your own MongoDB URI to make sure backend works properly.
